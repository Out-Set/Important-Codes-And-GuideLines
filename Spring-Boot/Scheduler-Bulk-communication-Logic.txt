In prepareCommunicationData:
============================

	1. pre-execution-query (THIRD PARTY DB): update status = I where status = N

	2. query (THIRD PARTY DB TO INTEGRATION DB): pick records with status = I and prepare-comm-data

	3. post-execution-query (THIRD PARTY DB): update status = P where status = I


In syncCommunicationStatus:
===========================

	1. pre-execution-query (INTEGRATION DB): select unique_identifier from communication_data_dtl where status = P AND status_synced = false

	2. query (THIRD PARTY DB): SET email_status = true where unique_identifier in (collected from pre-execution-query)

	3. post-execution-query (INTEGRATION DB): update status_synced = true where unique_identifier in (collected from pre-execution-query)
	
	
	
Previous queries:
-----------------
select id AS ID, comm_code AS COMM_CODE, comm_category AS COMM_CATEGORY, comm_data AS COMM_DATA, to_email_address AS TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS, email_subject AS SUBJECT, cc_email_address AS CC, bcc_email_address AS BCC, attachment_file_path AS ATTACHMENT_FILE_PATH, integration_proc_status AS INTEGRATION_PROCESS_STATUS from com_trail_dtl WHERE integration_proc_status = 'N'

UPDATE com_trail_dtl SET integration_proc_status = 'P' WHERE id IN

SELECT unique_identifier FROM communication_data_dtl WHERE environment = 'COLLECTFLOW' AND status = 'P' AND status_synced = false

UPDATE com_trail_dtl SET email_status = true, email_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP where id IN
